This website is a tool to assist people with OCD during treatment. The purpose of this site is to allow a user to track their progress ,expreiences and feelings during ERP treatment. ERP stands for exposure reasponse prevention. I have created this website to help people like myself who stuggle with OCD. This is my first build so it is not perfect, I am learning and adding as I go. 
The goal for this website is to be able to have a user register and login to their own page. After logging in the user will be able to create a ladder with fears/challenges. They can then use the fears/challenges on their ladder to tag journal entries. These tags will help sort which exposures go with which fear/challenge. I am hoping that this will help to show the user the progress they are making and help to push them forward through treatment.
